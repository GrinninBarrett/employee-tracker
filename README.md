This application is a command-line CMS that uses [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to allow users to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees of a company.

## Functionality


## Challenges
<!-- TODO: add challenges as they arise -->
* The first hurdle was learning the correct syntax for using `promise()` in a query. This causes the queries to be asynchronous, which is probably preferable here, but being sure all the correct items were included - in the right order - took longer than I expected.
* It took a lot of reading to finally understand more about the `JOIN` types in SQL. I was having trouble getting the `viewAllEmployees` query to show all employees, even if their manager type was `null`, and the easy fix to this was to use an `INNER JOIN` rather than a simple `JOIN`.
* I knew I needed to get a list of all managers (in case a new one had been added) by selecting them from the employees table, in order to use that array as the list of choices in the inquirer prompt while adding a new employee. However, because of how I was trying to keep the code modular and organized, it resulted in a circular dependency that was causing errors. I moved the function that queried the database to get all the managers from employees.js into the questions.js file, where the lists of questions for inquirer prompts are held, and that immediately fixed it.
